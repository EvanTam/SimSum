QUERY`Who was the first person to walk on the moon
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong`at Purdue University Armstrong announced shortly after the Apollo 11 flight that he did not plan to fly in space again.`[103] He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology, Advanced Research Projects Agency( ARPA), but served in this position for only a year, and resigned from it and NASA as a whole in 1971.`[104] He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati,[105] having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree.`[106] He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight.`The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering.`After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving.`[107] NASA accident investigations Armstrong served on two spaceflight accident investigations.`The first was in 1970, after Apollo 13, where as part of Edgar Cortwright's panel, he produced a detailed chronology of the flight.`Armstrong personally opposed the report's recommendation to re-design the service module's oxygen tanks, the source of the explosion.`[108] In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Rogers Commission which investigated the Space-shuttle Challenger disaster of that year.`As vice-chairman, Armstrong was in charge of the operational side of the commission.`[109] Business activities Neil Armstrong(second from right in the middle row) visits with U.`S.`Air Force members during a March 2010 USO stop in Southwest Asia.`Seated next to him on the left are astronauts Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan.`After Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses.`The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979.`Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, plus they were in financial difficulty.`He later acted as a spokesman for other companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America.`He acted as a spokesman for U.`S.`businesses only.`[110] Along with spokesman duties, he also served on the board of directors of several companies, including Marathon Oil, Learjet, Cinergy(Cincinnati Gas& Electric Company), Taft Broadcasting, United Airlines, Eaton Corporation, AIL Systems and Thiokol.`[111] He joined Thiokol's board after he served on the Rogers Commission; the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol-manufactured solid rocket boosters.`He retired as chairman of the board of EDO Corporation in 2002.`[112] Voice actor In 2010 he voiced the character of Dr.`Jack Morrow[113] in Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey, a 2010 animated educational sci-fi adventure film initiated by JPL/NASA through a grant from Jet Propulsion Lab.`[114] Personal life Armstrong speaks on the 50th anniversary of John Glenn's first spaceflight in February 2012.`Armstrong was approached by political groups from both ends of the spectrum after his aeronautical career.`Unlike former astronauts and U.`S.`Senators John Glenn(D-OH; 1974–1999 and Harrison Schmitt(R-NM; 1977-1983), Armstrong declined all offers.`Personally, he was in favor of states' rights and against the United States acting as the"world's policeman".`[115] In the late 1950s, Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop.`When asked for his religious affiliation, he labeled himself as a deist.`[116] His mother later said that Armstrong's religious views caused her grief and distress in later life as she was more religious.`[117] His official biography also describes him as a deist.`In 1972, Armstrong was welcomed into the town of Langholm, Scotland, the traditional seat of Clan Armstrong; he was made the first freeman of the burgh, and happily declared the town his home.`[118] The Justice of the Peace read from an unrepealed 400-year-old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town.`[119] In the fall of 1979, Armstrong was working at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio.`As he jumped off of the back of his grain truck, his wedding ring caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his ring finger.`He collected the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.`[120] In February 1991, a year after his father had died, and nine months after the death of his mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.`[121] Armstrong married his first wife Janet Shearon on January 28, 1956.`Their first son Eric was born in 1957, followed by daughter, Karen, in 1959.`Karen died of a brain tumor in January 1962, and the couple's second son Mark was born in 1963.`[122] Armstrong's first wife, Janet, divorced him in 1994, after 38 years of marriage.`[123] He had met his second wife, Carol Held Knight(b.`1945),[124]) in 1992 at a golf tournament, where they were seated together at the breakfast table.`She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later she received a call from him asking what she was doing—she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out.`They were married on June 12, 1994, in Ohio, and then had a second ceremony, at San Ysidro Ranch, in California.`He lived in Indian Hill, Ohio.`[125] Armstrong is generally referred to as a"reluctant" American Hero.`John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, recalled Armstrong's legendary humility.`"He didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself," the former Ohio senator told CNN.`[126]"He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before.`"" Fly Me to the Moon" to John Glenn(left) and Armstrong, September 24, 2008.`After 1994, Armstrong refused all requests for autographs because he found that his signed items were selling for large amounts of money and that many forgeries were in circulation; any requests that were sent to him received a form letter in reply, saying that he had stopped signing.`Although his no-autograph policy was well known, author Andrew Smith observed people at the 2002 Reno Air Races still trying to get signatures, with one person even claiming,"If you shove something close enough in front of his face, he'll sign.`"[127] He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts, because he believed these letters should come from people who know the Scouts personally.`[128] Use of Armstrong's name, image, and famous quote caused him problems over the years.`MTV wanted to use his quote for its now-famous identity depicting the Apollo 11 landing when it launched in 1981, but he declined.`[129] Armstrong sued Hallmark Cards in 1994 after they used his name and a recording of"one small step" quote in a Christmas ornament without permission.`The lawsuit was settled out of court[130] for an undisclosed amount of money which Armstrong donated to Purdue.`[131] In May 2005, Armstrong became involved in an unusual legal battle with his barber of 20 years, Marx Sizemore.`After cutting Armstrong's hair, Sizemore sold some of it to a collector for$3,000 without Armstrong's knowledge or permission.`[132] Armstrong threatened legal action unless the barber returned the hair or donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong's choosing.`Sizemore, unable to get the hair back, decided to donate the proceeds to the charity of Armstrong's choice.`[133] Since the early 1980s, Armstrong has been the subject of a hoax saying that he converted to Islam after hearing the adhan, the Muslim call to prayer, while walking on the moon.`The Indonesian singer Suhaemi wrote a song called"Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan"("The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon") which described Armstrong's conversion; the song was discussed widely in various Jakarta news outlets in 1983.`[134] Other similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia.`In March 1983, the U.`S.`State Department responded by issuing a global message to Muslims saying that Armstrong"has not converted to Islam".`[135] However, the hoax was not completely quieted; it surfaced occasionally for the next three decades.`A part of the confusion stems from the similarity between Armstrong's American residence in Lebanon, Ohio, and the country Lebanon which has a majority population of Muslims.`[135][136] Illness and death Photograph of Armstrong as a boy at his family memorial service in Indian Hill, Ohio near Cincinnati on August 31, 2012.`Armstrong underwent bypass surgery on August 7, 2012, to relieve blocked coronary arteries.`[137] Although he was reportedly recovering well,[138] he died on August 25, in Cincinnati, Ohio, after complications resulting from the cardiovascular procedure.`[3] After his death, Armstrong was described, in a statement released by the White House, as"among the greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time".`[139][140] The statement further said that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and that he had delivered"a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.`"[141] His family released a statement describing Armstrong as a"reluctant American hero[who had] served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut .`.`.`While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.`For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request.`Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.`"[142] This prompted many responses, including the Twitter hashtag"#WinkAtTheMoon".`[143] Armstrong's colleague on the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin, said that he was"deeply saddened by the passing.`I know I am joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew.`I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing .`.`.`Regrettably, this is not to be.`"[144][145] Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said, of Armstrong,"He was the best, and I will miss him terribly.`"[146][147] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that:"As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own".`[148][149] Armstrong's burial at sea on September 14, 2012 A tribute was held in Armstrong's honor on September 13 at Washington National Cathedral, whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of moon rock amid its stained-glass panels.`[150] In attendance were Armstrong's Apollo 11 crewmates, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin; Eugene A.`Cernan, the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man to walk on the moon; and former Senator and astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth.`In a eulogy, Charles Bolden said,"Neil will always be remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own, but it was the courage, grace, and humility he displayed throughout this life that lifted him above the stars.`" Eugene Cernan recalled Armstrong's low-fuel approach to the moon:"When the gauge says empty we all know there's a gallon or two left in the tank!`" Diana Krall sang the song" Fly Me to the Moon".`Michael Collins led prayers.`Aldrin and Collins left immediately after the event.`The Apollo 15 commander, David Scott, spoke to the press; he recalled the Gemini 8 mission with Armstrong when he spoke, possibly for the first time, about an incident in which glue spilled on his harness and prevented it from locking correctly minutes before the hatch had to be sealed or the mission aborted.`Armstrong then called on back-up pilot Pete Conrad to solve the problem, which he did, to continue the mission without stopping the countdown clock.`"That happened because Neil Armstrong was a team player, he always worked on behalf of the team.`"[150] On September 14, Armstrong's cremated remains were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean during a burial-at-sea ceremony aboard the USS Philippine Sea.`[151] Flags were flown at half-staff on the day of Armstrong's funeral.`[152] Legacy Armstrong and Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, Soviet Union, 1970 Armstrong received many honors and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the Robert H.`Goddard Memorial Trophy, the Sylvanus Thayer Award, the Collier Trophy from the National Aeronautics Association, and the Congressional Gold Medal.`The lunar crater Armstrong, 31 mi(50 km) from the Apollo 11 landing site, and asteroid 6469 Armstrong[153] are named in his honor.`Armstrong was also inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.`[154][155] Armstrong and his Apollo 11 crewmates were the 1999 recipients of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.`Throughout the United States, there are more than a dozen elementary, middle and high schools named in his honor,[156] and many places around the world have streets, buildings, schools, and other places named for Armstrong and/or Apollo.`[157] In 1969, folk songwriter and singer John Stewart recorded"Armstrong", a tribute to Armstrong and his first steps on the moon.`Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering in his honor;[158] the building cost$53.`2 million and was dedicated on October 27, 2007, during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue Astronauts.`[159] In 1971, Armstrong was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point for his service to the country.`[160] The Armstrong Air and Space Museum, in Armstong's hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio, and the airport in New Knoxville, where he took his first flying lessons when he was fifteen, after named after him.`[161][162][163] Michael Collins, President George W.`Bush, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin during celebrations of the 35th anniversary of the Apollo 11 flight, July 21, 2004 Armstrong's authorized biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A.`Armstrong, was published in 2005.`For many years, Armstrong turned down biography offers from authors such as Stephen Ambrose and James A.`Michener, but agreed to work with James R.`Hansen after reading one of Hansen's other biographies.`[164] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Armstrong was ranked as the#1 most popular space hero.`[165] The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight.`In 2005, Armstrong said that a manned mission to Mars will be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s:"I suspect that even though the various questions are difficult and many, they are not as difficult and many as those we faced when we started the Apollo[space program] in 1961.`" In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares 1 launch vehicle and the Constellation moon landing program.`[166] In an open public letter also signed by Apollo veterans Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan, he noted,"For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature".`[167] Armstrong had also publicly recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50 percent chance of landing on the moon.`"I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful", he later said.`[168] On November 18, 2010, at age 80, Armstrong said in a speech during the Science& Technology Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked.`[169] In September 2012, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that the first Armstrong-class oceanographic research ship will be named RV Neil Armstrong.`The ship(currently under construction) will be a modern oceanographic research platform capable of supporting a wide range of oceanographic research activities conducted by academic groups.`[170] The Space Foundation named Neil Armstrong as a recipient of its 2013 General James E.`Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

http://history1900s.about.com/od/1960s/p/firstmanmoon.htm`  Who Was the First Man on the Moon?`For thousands of years, man had looked to the heavens and dreamed of walking on the moon.`In 1969, as part of the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong became the very first to accomplish that dream, followed only minutes later by Buzz Aldrin.`Their accomplishment placed the United States ahead of the Soviets in the Space Race and gave people around the world the hope of future space exploration.`Dates: July 20, 1969 Also Known As: First Moon Landing, First Man to Walk on the Moon Crew Aboard Apollo 11: Neil Armstrong, Edwin"Buzz" Aldrin, Michael Collins Overview of the First Man on the Moon: When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, the United States was surprised to find themselves behind in the race to space.`Still behind the Soviets in the Space Race four years later, President John F.`Kennedy gave inspiration and hope to the American people in his speech to Congress on May 25, 1961 in which he stated,"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.`" Just eight years later, the United States accomplished this goal by placing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon.`Take Off!`At 9:32 a.`m.`on July 16, 1969, the Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 into the sky from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.`On the ground there were over 3,000 journalists, 7,000 dignitaries, and approximately a half million tourists watching this momentous occasion.`The event went smoothly and as scheduled.`After one-and-a-half orbits around earth, the Saturn V thrusters flared once again and the crew had to manage the delicate process of attaching the lunar module(nicknamed Eagle) onto the nose of the joined command and service module(nicknamed Columbia).`Once attached, Apollo 11 left the Saturn V rockets behind as they began their three-day journey to the moon, called the translunar coast.`A Difficult Landing On July 19, at 1:28 p.`m.`EDT, Apollo 11 entered the moon's orbit.`After spending a full day in lunar orbit, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin boarded the lunar module and detached it from the command module for their descent to the moon's surface.`As the Eagle departed, Michael Collins, who remained in the Columbia while Armstrong and Aldrin were on the moon, checked for any visual problems with the lunar module.`He saw none and told the Eagle crew,"You cats take it easy on the lunar surface.`" As the Eagle headed toward the moon's surface, several different warning alarms were activated.`Armstrong and Aldrin realized that the computer system was guiding them to a landing area that was strewn with boulders the size of small cars.`With some last minute maneuvers, Armstrong guided the lunar module to a safe landing area.`At 4:17 p.`m.`EDT on July 20, 1969, the landing module landed on the moon's surface in the Sea of Tranquility with only seconds of fuel left.`Armstrong reported to the command center in Houston,"Houston, Tranquility Base here.`The Eagle has landed.`" Houston responded,"Roger, Tranquility.`We copy you on the ground.`You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.`We're breathing again.`" Walking on the Moon After the excitement, exertion, and drama of the lunar landing, Armstrong and Aldrin spent the next six-and-a-half hours resting and then preparing themselves for their moon walk.`At 10:28 p.`m.`EDT, Armstrong turned on the video cameras.`These cameras transmitted images from the moon to over half a billion people on earth who sat watching their televisions.`It was phenomenal that these people were able to witness the amazing events that were unfolding hundreds of thousands of miles above them.`Neil Armstrong was the first person out of the lunar module.`He climbed down a ladder and then became the first person to set foot on the moon at 10:56 p.`m.`EDT.`Armstrong then stated,"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.`" A few minutes later, Aldrin exited the lunar module and stepped foot on the moon's surface.`Leaving the Surface Although Armstrong and Aldrin got a chance to admire the tranquil, desolate beauty of the moon's surface, they also had a lot of work to do.`NASA had sent the astronauts with a number of scientific experiments to set up and the men were to collect samples from the area around their landing site.`They returned with 46 pounds of moon rocks.`Armstrong and Aldrin also set up a flag of the United States.`While on the moon, the astronauts received a call from President Richard Nixon.`Nixon began by saying,"Hello, Neil and Buzz.`I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Office of the White House.`And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone calls ever made.`I just can't tell you how proud we are of what you have done.`" After spending 21 hours and 36 minutes upon the moon(including 2 hours and 31 minutes of outside exploration), it was time for Armstrong and Aldrin to leave.`To lighten their load, the two men threw out some excess materials like backpacks, moon boots, urine bags, and a camera.`These fell to the moon's surface and were to remain there.`Also left behind was a plaque which read,"Here men from the planet earth first set foot upon the moon.`July 1969, A.`D.`We came in peace for all mankind.`" The lunar module blasted off from the moon's surface at 1:54 p.`m.`EDT on July 21, 1969.`Everything went well and the Eagle re-docked with the Columbia.`After transferring all of their samples onto the Columbia, the Eagle was set adrift in the moon's orbit.`The Columbia, with all three astronauts back on board, then began their three day journey back to earth.`Splash Down Before the Columbia command module entered the earth's atmosphere, it separated itself from the service module.`When the capsule reached 24,000 feet, three parachutes deployed to slow down the Columbia's descent.`At 12:50 p.`m.`EDT on July 24, the Columbia safely landed in the Pacific Ocean, southwest of Hawaii.`They landed just 13 nautical miles from the U.`S.`S.`Hornet that was scheduled to pick them up.`Once picked up, the three astronauts were immediately placed into quarantine for fears of possible moon germs.`Three days after being retrieved, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins were transferred to a quarantine facility in Houston for further observation.`On August 10, 1969, 17 days after splash down, the three astronauts were released from quarantine and able to return to their families.`The astronauts were treated like heroes on their return.`They were met by President Nixon and given ticker-tape parades.`These men had accomplished what men had only dared to dream for thousands of years- to walk on the moon.

complications from heart surgery he underwent earlier this month.`The ex-astronaut  underwent cardiac bypass surgery just two days after his birthday on Aug.`5.`Edwin"Buzz" Aldrin, the colleague who also walked on the moon, sent out a statement late afternoon on Saturday.`"I know I am joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew," said Aldrin.` "My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will forever be remembered as a landmark moment in human history.`I had truly hoped that in 2019, we would be standing together along with our colleague Mike Collins to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing.`Regrettably, this is not to be.`Neil will most certainly be there with us in spirit.`"'The enormous power of one small step' U.`S.`President Barack Obama hailed Armstrong as one of America's greatest heroes in a statement, calling Armstrong's first steps on the moon"a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.`""Neil’s spirit of discovery lives on in all the men and women who have devoted their lives to exploring the unknown– including those who are ensuring that we reach higher and go further in space.`That legacy will endure– sparked by a man who taught us the enormous power of one small step.`" NASA chief Charles Bolden recalled Armstrong's legacy:"[He] will be remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own.`" Family Statement"Neil was our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend.`Neil Armstrong was also a reluctant American hero who always believed he was just doing his job.`He served his Nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut.`He also found success back home in his native Ohio in business and academia, and became a community leader in Cincinnati.`He remained an advocate of aviation and exploration throughout his life and never lost his boyhood wonder of these pursuits.`While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.`For those who may ask what they can do to honour Neil, we have a simple request.`Honour his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.`" CBC News Chief Correspondent Peter Mansbridge called the moon landing an unforgettable event — one that was watched by an estimated 600 million people.`"That was a day of a global village, to quote Marshall McLuhan, we were all sharing this one event.`" Mansbridge, on the phone to CBC News Network, said he had the privilege of going to news conferences in the 1970s where Armstrong would be speaking.`"He didn’t seem very outgoing, he wasn't someone who couldn’t wait to get in front of a camera or microphone.`He had a life that was without blemish," said Mansbridge.`"Neil Armstrong was a true hero.`" Marc Garneau, who was the first Canadian to fly on a NASA mission to space, was 20 years old when Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969.`Garneau, who is now a Liberal MP, said he listened to Armstrong's lunar landing on the radio.`"It was a beautiful moon-lit night and I was seized by this historical moment and I didn’t really believe that it was possible.`Of course, this was a great achievement, the first human being to set foot on another celestial body," Garneau said in an interview.`Garneau said Armstrong was a"modest" and"unassuming" man when he met him.`Test pilot Born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Aug.`5, 1930, Armstrong went on to get a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Purdue University and a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Southern California.`According to the NASA website, Armstrong joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics(NACA) in 1955.`NACA was the predecessor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA).`During his 17 years at NACA in Cleveland, he was an engineer, test pilot, astronaut and administrator.`Armstrong then became a research pilot at NASA's Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif.`, and flew many pioneering high-speed aircraft.`He flew over 200 different models of aircraft, rockets, helicopters and gliders, said the website.`Armstrong was upgraded to astronaut status in 1962.`Assigned as command pilot for the Gemini 8 mission, he performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space on March 16, 1966.`In reflecting on his historic moment on the moon, Armstrong said the"sights were simply magnificent, beyond any visual experience that I had ever been exposed to.`" After the moon landing, Armstrong subsequently held the position of Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.`C.`Shunned attention Armstrong was known for his humility.` Despite his fame, he never sought the spotlight.`Appearing in Dayton, Ohio, in 2003  to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight, Armstrong spoke for only a few seconds to a crowd of 10,000 before leaving the stage.`Former astronaut and senator John Glenn has described his friend and colleague as"exceptionally brilliant" but"rather retiring.`" Eventually, he was a Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati between 1971 to 1979.`And, from 1982 to1992, Armstrong was chair of Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc.`, Charlottesville, Va.`His many honours include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Space Medal of Honour, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Royal Geographic Society's Gold Medal.`Despite all the accolades, Armstrong said he always thought of himself as an engineer.`"I am, and ever will be, a white socks, pocket protector, nerdy engineer," he stated in one of his 2000 interviews.`"And I take a substantial amount of pride in the accomplishments of my profession.
